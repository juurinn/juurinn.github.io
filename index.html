        <h2>(SpaceGame)</h2>
        <p>
            SpaceGame is competetive physics based game about navigating spaceship trough different mazes against the clock. This projects goal was to teach us on how to work as a team in game development while also producing somewhat finished game.
        </p>
        <h2>(Tower Defence)</h2>
        <p>
            Tower Defence is pretty self describing. Our goal in this project was to learn more about Unity and especially the programming side of a game while still further developing our team work skills. We wanted to make the game as replayable as we could which we think we achieved by randomizing the level generation using a seed which you can share if you want to compete against others.  
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose of the site</h2>
        <p>
            This is showcase about (SpaceGame) and (TowerDefence). Main reason this website was created to help us show our projects for employment purposes. Both of the games will also be released on itch.io when they are finished soonâ„¢.
